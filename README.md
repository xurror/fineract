Apache Fineract: A Platform for Microfinance  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/fineract.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/fineract)  [![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/apache/fineract.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract)  [![Docker Build](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/apache/fineract.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract/builds)
============

Fineract is a mature platform with open APIs that provides a reliable, robust, and affordable core banking solution for financial institutions offering services to the worldâ€™s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

[Have a look at the FAQ on our Wiki at apache.org](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/FAQ) if this README does not answer what you are looking for.

[![Code Now! (Gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/apache/fineract)
to start contributing to this project in the online web-based IDE GitPod.io right away!
(You may initially have to press F1 to Find Command and run "Java: Start Language Server".)
It's of course also possible to contribute with a "traditional" local development environment (see below).

Community
=========

If you are interested in contributing to this project, but perhaps don't quite know how and where to get started, please [join our developer mailing list](http://fineract.apache.org/#contribute), listen into our conversations, chime into threads, and just send us a friendly "Hello!" introduction email; we're a friendly bunch, and look forward to hearing from you.


Requirements
============
* Java >= 1.8 (Oracle JVMs have been tested)
* MySQL 5.5

You can run the required version of the database server in a container, instead of having to install it, like this:

    docker run --name mysql-5.5 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mysql:5.5

and stop and destroy it like this:

    docker rm -f mysql-5.5

Beware that this database container database keeps its state inside the container and not on the host filesystem.  It is lost when you destroy (rm) this container.  This is typically fine for development.  See [Caveats: Where to Store Data on the database container documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) re. how to make it persistent instead of ephemeral.


Instructions how to run for local development
============

Run the following commands:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default`
1. `./gradlew tomcatRunWAR`


Instructions to download gradle wrapper
============
The file fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar binary is checked into this projects Git source repository,
but won't exist in your copy of the Fineract codebase if you downloaded a released source archive from apache.org.
In that case, you need to download it using the commands below:

    wget --no-check-certificate -P fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

(or)

    curl --insecure -L https://github.com/apache/fineract/raw/develop/fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar > fineract-provider/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar


Instructions to run Apache RAT (Release Audit Tool)
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew rat`. A report will be generated under build/reports/rat/rat-report.txt


Instructions to build a WAR file
============
1. Extract the archive file to your local directory.
2. Run `./gradlew clean war` or `./gradlew build` to build a deployable war file which will be created at build/libs directory.


Instructions to execute Integration tests
============
> Note that if this is the first time to access MySQL DB, then you may need to reset your password.

Run the following commands, very similarly to how [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) does:
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants`
1. `./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default`
1. `./gradlew clean integrationTest`


Instructions to run using Docker and docker-compose
===================================================

It is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using containers (AKA "Docker").

As Prerequisites, you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine; see
[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and
[Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Alternatively, you can also use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod)
(e.g. via `dnf install podman-docker`), and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/)
(e.g. via `pip3 install podman-compose`) instead of Docker.

Now to run a new Fineract instance you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract`
1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up -d`
1. Fineract will run at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider now!

The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) will build the `fineract` container from the source based on the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract has a pre-built container of this project, built continuously.

You must specify the MySQL tenants database JDBC URL by passing it to the `fineract` container via environment
variables; please consult the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for exact details how to specify those.
_(Note that in previous versions, the `mysqlserver` environment variable used at `docker build` time instead of at
`docker run` time did something similar; this has changed in [FINERACT-773](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-773)),
and the `mysqlserver` environment variable is now no longer supported.)_


Instructions to run using minikube and kubectl
===================================================

You can also run Fineract using containers on a kubernetes cluster.

As Prerequisites, you must have `minikube` and `kubectl` installed on your machine; see
[Minikube & Kubectl install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

Now to run a new Fineract instance on minikube you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract`
1. `minikube start --mount-string="./fineract-db/docker:/fineract-db" --mount --vm-driver=virtualbox`
1. `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/fineractmysql-deployment.yml`
1. `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/fineract-server-deployment.yml`
1. `minikube service fineract-server --url`
1. Fineract will run at the provided url
NB : Change protocol from http to https
=======================================

To check the status of your containers on kubernetes cluster, run:
    `minikube dashboard`


Checkstyle
============

This project enforces its code conventions using [checkstyle.xml](fineract-provider/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml).  It is configured to run automatically during the normal Gradle build, and fail if there are any style violations detected.
We recommend that you configure your favourite Java IDE to match those conventions.  For Eclipse, you can
File > Import > General > Preferences our [config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf](config/fineractdev-eclipse-preferences.epf).
You could also use Checkstyle directly in your IDE (but you don't neccesarily have to, it may just be more convenient for you).  For Eclipse, use https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/ and load our checkstyle.xml into it.

The Connector/J JDBC Driver client library from MariaDB.org, which is licensed under the LGPL,
is used in development when running integration tests that use the Flyway library.  That JDBC
driver is however not included in and distributed with the Fineract product and is not
required to use the product.
If you are developer and object to using the LGPL licensed Connector/J JDBC driver,
simply do not run the integration tests that use the Flyway library.
